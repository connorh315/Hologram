# Fragment

Fragment is a tool that will allow you to mesh import into Dimensions / The Skywalker Saga GSC files!

There is still a long way to go until this is a complete tool, it stil needs UV mapping as well as individual vertex colouring - but it's a good start for now.

# How to use

Download the latest release from the "Releases" tab on the right hand side. Extract it and then make sure you have .NET 6 64-Bit installed and you will be able to run it.

As soon as it opens you can load a .GSC file from either Dimensions or TSS and then start overriding the individual parts with your own .OBJ files!

# Why is it called Fragment?

That's because most of the code for this is derived from a different project I'm working on, called Hologram. However that still requires a lot more work before it is complete and as such this tool is a branch of Hologram that will only ever be used to import into GSCs, unlike Hologram's much wider purpose.

# Credits

Credits go to Sluicer for doing most of the work in reading and extracting .GSC files with their set of Extract_MESH tools (of which I have derived most of my understanding of GSC files from)

Additionally, a massive thank you to Bowie and CyberNovaDW for their support in testing the tool!
